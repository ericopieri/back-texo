## Installation and Configuration Guide

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Poetry

> Note: [Poetry Installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

### Step 1: Clone the Project Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ericopieri/django_texo.git
```

### Step 2: Package Installation and Virtual Environment Creation

Commands designated for installing required project packages, creating and activating the virtual environment to run the project.

```
cd django_texo
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry install
poetry shell
```

> **Note:** It's important that all commands run internally in Django from here onwards are executed with the virtual environment activated (`poetry shell`).

## Step 3: Migrating Databases

Run both migrations sequentially, which will create database files (default and test).

```
poetry run python manage.py migrate
poetry run python manage.py migrate --database=test
```

## Step 4: Dumping Data from CSV for Application Functionality

The `dump_movie_data` command will parse the required movie CSV and add items to the database.

```
poetry run python manage.py dump_movie_data
```

## Step 5: Running the Application! Voil√†!

Run the command to start the application. [Access here!](http://localhost:8000/)

```
poetry run python manage.py runserver
```

## Step 6: Running Integration Tests

Test data has been mocked.

```
poetry run python manage.py test
```

## Step 7: Accessing the Proposal Endpoint

**/api/maxminwinnerinterval/** - This endpoint returns, in a JSON data set, the producer with the longest interval between two consecutive awards, and the one who
